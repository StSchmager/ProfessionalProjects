# Professional Projects
As a Marketing Analyst at a local, multi-store grocery retailer; I read, process, manipulate, and analyze a lot of sales and transaction data with the help of the R statistical programming language.
All my data-reading/processing scripts are documented here.

## Sales-Data Analyses
R script which reads, processes, cleans, and joins numerous, ill-formatted, messy Excel reports and results in a system of datasets with different aggregation/detail levels that are manageable for further data exploration, analysis, and visualization in Tableau.

## Transaction-Data Analyses
This R script is pivotal to my first analysis of (customer ZIP codes extracted from) transaction data which are stored in XML files. It takes in complex, tree-structured data from thousands of XML files; each file contains sales transaction information (e.g. customer number, items purchased, sales totals, date/time, et cetera) that's collected at each checkout lane, in each retail store, each day. Those data are then read, munged and joined/enhanced with additional data from external data sources (e.g. customer file). Ultimately, the data output is simplified: compared to the initial tree-structured input data, the output consist of tabular CSV datasets with various detail levels (subsets/aggregations) that are then used for research-question based data exploration, analyses, visualizations, and communication/presentation with the help of Tableau.
