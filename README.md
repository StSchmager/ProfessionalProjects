# Professional Projects
As a Marketing Analyst at a local and multi-store grocery retailer, I utilize (read/clean/manipulate/join/analyze/export) a seizable amount of sales and transaction data with the help of the R statistical programming language. All my data-reading/processing/analysis scripts are documented here.

I work one two overall kinds of projects that may be clustered according to their underlying data utilized: sales and transactional data. Further, auxiliary data such as __Product Categorization__ needs to be established to facilitate better effective __Analysis of Sales and Transaction Data__.

## Product Categorization

The category of a product (e.g. "Canned Tomato Sauce") is an important data point that bridges the gap between a too broad grouping variable like main- or sub-departments (e.g. "Grocery") and the too detailed item entity of SKUs (e.g. "16 oz. Tomato Sauce of Brand XYZ"). On the one hand, categories help break down aggregated department data and determine the sales drivers within a departemnt (see Ad & Sales Reporting). On the other hand, categories help lift SKU-level findings to a more general, meaningful level of findings that is not noo general, hence, not meaningful as in the case of departments.

## Sales-Data Analyses

Specific analyses and their desired outcomes that I have been working on are:

* __Ad & Sales Reporting__ to inform the company owners, department buyers, and store managers about sales of ad-featured items in certain categories, departments, stores, and combinations thereof from various perspectives.
* __Marketing-Mix-Modelling__ to determine price elasticity, sales impact of various price points, as well as the impact of an ad-feature of items in certain categories, departments, stores, and combinations thereof.

## Transaction-Data Analyses

Specific analyses and their desired outcomes that I have been working on are:

* __Customer ZIP-Code Analysis__: Utilize ZIP-code related sales and customers counts (cashiers survey customers for home ZIP codes and tie them to customer transaction), compare to ZIP-code specific ad-printing/distribution marketing costs, and built ROI model to help re-allocate ad spending perfor each store location.
* __Market Basket Analysis__: Find _Association Rules_ among (sets of items) in order to generate incremental sales by cross-merchandising associated items, e.g. "If item of category X is purchased, then there's a ##.#% probability that product of categories Y and Z are in the same market basket / customer transaaction".
